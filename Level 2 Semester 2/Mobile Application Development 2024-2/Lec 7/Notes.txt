*********************************************Lecture 7 Notes******************************************

Container VS Expander >> Expander: Tells its child to take all remaining space, Useful for responsive layouts
		      >> Container: control its size explicitly with width and height

Container wrapped inside Expanded in columns or rows >> to fill remaining spaces equally

width: double.infinity >> make highest width value


Need to style column item >> Wrap inside decoration and use decoration:BoxDecoration
Example: decoration: BoxDecoration(
                      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20),
                      color: Colors.grey[400] 
                    ),

padding: const EdgeInsets.all(20), >> use const for static views/settings to be ready at compile time and make app fast
				   >> use padding as widget to apply item padding, usually used as parent to rows, columns, containers

//Baseline alignment usually need type of baseline which is alphabetic
crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.baseline,
textBaseline: TextBaseline.alphabetic,


FloatingActionButton(
                              onPressed: ()=>{},
                              backgroundColor: Colors.blue[400],
                              foregroundColor: Colors.white,
                              mini: true,
                              child: Icon(Icons.minimize),
                              )
MaterialButton

You need click on item that hasn't click event >> wrap inside GestureDetector widget

value.round() // round double value


***********************************************Lab changes***********************************************

1- replace Male and Female Icons with asset images
2- make CM is aligned to the baseline of 180 instead of align to end, what is the diff between align to end or baseline?
3- the slider is not moving with your touch, What is the problem? Fix it!!
4- Male and Female click toggle between them, Modify the code to make click on active option deselect it.
5- use shape: const CircleBorder(), to make floatingButtons rounded
6- Handle  plus/minus click for the last section
7- in the result screen, make constructor to receive data from home screen. the data need to be received:
	- Gender: Male or Female based on selection
	- Age: age here
	- Result of BMI based on this equation ()
